**What, when and where is the expected behaviour?**
_TLDR; Provide Time, Space and expectation information._
Example: When I click the button called "lottery" on the top left of the screen in the System/Settings/Wealth submenu, I would like to become rich and famous.
This should look like this: $$$ :+1: 
Keep in mind that I have to reproduce the bug.

**What went wrong?**
_TLDR; Provide information in contrast with the expectation_
Well, I'm famous but still not rich. My shrink says the problem comes from this button, which obviously doesn't work. When I click nothing happen, really - nothing.
This look like this instead: :+1: :-(

**Screenshot**
_TLDR; Well, a picture says a thousand words_
